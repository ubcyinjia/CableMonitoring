# CableMonitoring

We have included time-series predictors in the folder predictor and a cable anomaly detector in the folder detector.

The results of the ARIMA predictor can be generated by running the script ./predictor/ARIMA_predictor.m

The results of the neural-network predctiors can be generated by running the scripts ./predictor/NN_Data_Prepare_test.m, ./predictor/neural_network(_LSTM).py, NN_test_script.m, in order.

The results for the detector can be generated by running the script ./detector/detector.m
